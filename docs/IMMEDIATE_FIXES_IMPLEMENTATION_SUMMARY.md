## Configuration Values

| Setting                 | Value    | Description                  |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Throttle Interval       | 100ms    | Chart update frequency limit |

| Flush Interval          | 1000ms   | Automatic flush timer        |
| Max Data Points         | 1000     | Chart data point limit       |
| Cleanup Interval        | 30s      | Memory cleanup frequency     |
| Max Reconnect Attempts  | 10       | SSE reconnection limit       |

## Files Modified

1. **`public/js/analysis-chart-component.js`** - Main implementation file
2. **`scripts/test_immediate_fixes.php`** - PHP test script
3. **`public/test-immediate-fixes.html`** - Browser test page

## Testing

### PHP Test Script

```bash
php scripts/test_immediate_fixes.php
```

### Browser Test Page

Open `public/test-immediate-fixes.html` in a web browser to test:

-   Throttling functionality
-   Data buffering
-   Memory management
-   Performance monitoring
-   Chart updates

## Expected Results

### Immediate Improvements

-   **CPU Usage**: Drop from 100% to <50%
-   **Browser Stability**: No more crashes with high-frequency data
-   **Chart Performance**: Smoother updates with 100ms intervals
-   **Memory Usage**: Stable memory consumption
-   **Connection Reliability**: Automatic SSE reconnection

### Performance Metrics

-   **Render Frequency**: Limited to 10 updates per second (100ms intervals)
-   **Buffer Efficiency**: Data processed in batches of 50 items
-   **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup every 30 seconds
-   **Connection Resilience**: Up to 10 reconnection attempts

## How It Works

### 1. Data Flow

```
SSE Data → DataBuffer → Aggregation → ChartThrottler → Chart Update
```

### 2. Throttling Process

1. Incoming data is added to the buffer
2. Buffer flushes when full (50 items) or after 1 second
3. Data is aggregated and sent to throttler
4. Throttler ensures updates happen at most every 100ms
5. Chart is updated with throttled data

### 3. Memory Management

1. New data is added to ChartDataManager
2. Data points are limited to 1000 maximum
3. Old data (>5 minutes) is automatically removed
4. Cleanup runs every 30 seconds

### 4. Connection Resilience

1. SSE connection is managed by SSEManager
2. Automatic reconnection on connection loss
3. Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the server
4. Connection state is properly managed

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logs

-   Performance metrics every 5 seconds
-   Buffer flush notifications
-   Throttling information
-   Connection status updates
-   Memory usage warnings

### Performance Alerts

-   High memory usage (>100MB)
-   High render count (>100)
-   Connection failures
-   Buffer overflow warnings

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing

-   [ ] Test with real SSE data
-   [ ] Verify throttling is working
-   [ ] Monitor memory usage
-   [ ] Test connection resilience

### 2. Fine-tuning

-   [ ] Adjust throttle interval if needed
-   [ ] Optimize buffer size
-   [ ] Tune cleanup intervals
-   [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### 3. Production Deployment

-   [ ] Deploy to staging environment
-   [ ] Monitor performance in production
-   [ ] Collect user feedback
-   [ ] Make final adjustments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Throttling not working**: Check if ChartThrottler is initialized
2. **Buffer not flushing**: Verify flush callback is set
3. **Memory still high**: Check cleanup timer is running
4. **Connection issues**: Verify SSEManager configuration

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check throttler status
console.log(window.chartThrottler);

// Check buffer status
console.log(window.dataBuffer);

// Check performance metrics
console.log(window.performanceTracker.metrics);

// Force buffer flush
window.dataBuffer.flush();
```

## Conclusion

The immediate fixes implementation provides a robust solution to the data firehose problem by:

-   Preventing excessive chart updates through throttling
-   Efficiently processing data through buffering
-   Managing memory usage automatically
-   Providing robust SSE connection handling
-   Monitoring performance in real-time

This implementation should significantly improve the application's performance and stability while maintaining real-time data visualization capabilities.
