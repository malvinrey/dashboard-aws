# Export Download Fix

## Problem

The export functionality was failing with a 404 error when trying to download CSV files. The issue was caused by:

1. Incorrect file path handling in the ExportService
2. Missing proper download route configuration
3. Storage link not being properly set up
4. Browser download behavior not being properly triggered

## Solution

### 1. Created ExportController

-   **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ExportController.php`
-   **Purpose**: Handles file downloads with proper HTTP headers for browser download behavior
-   **Features**:
    -   Validates file existence
    -   Sets proper Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers
    -   Uses Laravel's Storage facade for file access

### 2. Updated ExportService

-   **File**: `app/Services/ExportService.php`
-   **Changes**:
    -   Replaced direct file system operations with Laravel Storage facade
    -   Added proper CSV string generation method
    -   Improved file path handling using Storage disk

### 3. Updated Routes

-   **File**: `routes/web.php`
-   **Changes**:
    -   Replaced inline route with proper controller method
    -   Route: `/export/download/{filename}` → `ExportController@download`

### 4. Updated View

-   **File**: `resources/views/livewire/log-data.blade.php`
-   **Changes**:
    -   Updated download link to use new route
    -   Added automatic download trigger after export success
    -   Improved user experience with proper download behavior

### 5. Storage Link Setup

-   **Command**: `php artisan storage:link`
-   **Purpose**: Creates symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`
-   **Result**: Files in storage are now accessible via web

## How It Works Now

1. **Export Process**:

    - User clicks "Export CSV" button
    - ExportService creates CSV file in `storage/app/public/exports/`
    - File is stored using Laravel Storage facade

2. **Download Process**:

    - ExportController handles download requests
    - Validates file existence
    - Returns file with proper headers for browser download
    - Browser automatically downloads file to user's Downloads folder

3. **User Experience**:
    - Export success notification appears
    - Download starts automatically after 500ms
    - Manual download link also available in notification

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
php scripts/test_export_download.php
```

## Files Modified

-   `app/Http/Controllers/ExportController.php` (new)
-   `app/Services/ExportService.php`
-   `routes/web.php`
-   `resources/views/livewire/log-data.blade.php`
-   `scripts/test_export_download.php` (new)
